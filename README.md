# Hello Lynx R1
![IMG_20231026_163222](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1/assets/20149493/c9f97f63-e357-416d-8429-18277b156780)


Hello to you. 

Fan of the philosophy of the device Lynx R1 more that the technical advantage of the headset, this repository is a landing respository to learn the Lynx R1 and indirectly the Quest 3.

What you can expect here are:
- note of my researches on the topic
- note on my attempt to create tutorial and workshop
- small demo from my attempts and workshop tutorial
- tutorial build for workshop in real life
- 3D assets or code made for the headset
- redirection to other tutorials on the web on the topic
- ...

Basicaly, if you want to work on the device this repository is a good place to start but not a "ready to read and learn" one.

Feel free to contact me on Discord for any questions:    
https://eloistree.github.io/r/discord  
_( I am also always on the Unofficial Lynx Discord:_  
_https://discord.gg/4udE5PWHxj )_    


## My goals


Personnaly, my goal with the Lynx is going to be:  
- Having fun exploring what we can do with it in experiment, game jam and small contract with client
- Re-learn how to do XR interaction to build remote control software in AR
- Learn what library of AR can be use on the Lynx R1 (and the Quest 3)
- Create tool to be able to anchor in space interaction menu and object
- Play to game on cross-platform from the headset  
- Teach in small workshop how to use the device from 2024 to 2026.  

If feel that you are in one of those sections, I invite you to follow my work.

Find here steps of my exploration on how to use Lynx R1.

This company is amazing and the device is what the community is expecting of Quest but is not receiving because of Mark Z. lock system.
