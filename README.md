# Hello Lynx R1

Hello to you. 

Fan of the philosophy of the device Lynx R1 more that the technical advantage of the headset, this repository is a landing respository to learn the Lynx R1 and indirectly the Quest 3.

What you can expect here are:
- note of my researches on the topic
- note on my attempt to create tutorial and workshop
- small demo from my attempts and workshop tutorial
- tutorial build for workshop in real life
- 3D assets or code made for the headset
- redirection to other tutorials on the web on the topic
- ...

Basicaly, if you want to work on the device this repository is a good place to start but not a ready to read and learn one.

Feel free to contact me on Discord for any questions:

## My goals


Personnaly, my goal with the Lynx is going to be:  
- Having fun exploring what we can do with it in experiment, game jam and small contract with client
- Re-learn how to do XR interaction to build remote control software in AR
- Learn what library of AR can be use on the Lynx R1 (and the Quest 3)
- Create tool to be able to anchor in space interaction menu and object
- Play to game on cross-platform from the headset  
- Teach in small workshop how to use the device from 2024 to 2026.  

If feel that you are in one of those sections, I invite you to follow my work.

So this Git is a guide of how to use Lynx based on my relearing of how to do Quest/Lynx application through Open XR.

Feel free to explore and ask question.

(I don't have the device yet. I works in advance)
